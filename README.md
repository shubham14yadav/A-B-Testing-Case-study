# A-B-Testing-Case-study Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Vungle A/B testing case study. Utilizing the MD5 hashing algorithm, we explore the effectiveness of two different ad-serving algorithms, A and B, in the context of mobile advertising. The analysis is centered on various metrics such as eRPM (effective revenue per 1,000 impressions), conversion rates, and overall performance efficiency.

Key Components:
<b>User Assignment</b>: We examine how users were distributed between Algorithms A and B, with a focus on the 15/16 to 1/16 proportion established via MD5 hashing.<br>
<br>
<b>Effectiveness Metrics</b>: The primary metric used for assessing the campaign's success is eRPM, offering insights into the revenue generation capabilities of each algorithm.<br>
<br>
<b>Algorithm Comparison</b>: Through statistical tests like the 2-sample and paired t-tests, we compare the mean eRPMs of both algorithms to determine the superior performer.<br>
<br>
<b>Conversion Rates</b>: We calculate and compare the conversion rates for each algorithm, providing a clear view of their effectiveness in user engagement.<br>
<br>
<b>Statistical Significance</b>: Utilizing a proportions test, we assess which algorithm demonstrates statistically significant better performance based on conversion rates.
